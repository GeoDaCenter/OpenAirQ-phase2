# OpenAirQ-models
Current projection is UTM zone 16.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| PM2.5 | The target variable for modeling: particulate matter â‰¤ 2.5Î¼m in dameter. |
| AOD | Aerosol Optical Depth |
| NDVI | Normalized Difference Vegetation Index |
| PS | A kernel density estimate of the number of PM2.5 emissions sources. |
| Road Density | Separated into Primary/Secondary/Motorway roads; motorways are the most important roads, followed by primary and then secondary |
| Land Cover Development | Separated into low/medium/high intensity development |
| Population Density | Tract-level population density |
| TEMP | Temperature in Fahrenheit |
| RELH | Relative Humidity |
| WDVL | Wind Velocity in knots |
| MSLP | Mean Sea Level Pressure |
| VSBY | Visibility in miles |
| Elev | Elevation |
| PBL | Planetary Boundary Layer; TBD |

I also have the full 21 counties dataset on my computer, if that would be a useful link.
