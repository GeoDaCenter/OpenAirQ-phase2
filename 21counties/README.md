21 Counties Model
Rasters for the output of the 21-county models, and a table of the test statistics for the models.  

Note that in the performance table, test statistics are calculated across folds for the base model `base` and model with outliers `outlier`. For the spatially cross-validated model `spatialcv`, test statistics are calculated across sensors. 10 folds were used for the models, compared to 32 sensors.
